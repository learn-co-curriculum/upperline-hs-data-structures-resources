### Arrays and Hashes Resources
Interested in learning more about Ruby's data structures? Here are some great resources that can help!

+ [The Bastard's Book of Ruby on Collections](http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/chapters/collections/). (Don't let the name "Collections" scare you. It's just another word for "Data Structures"!)

+ [Chris Pine's Learn To Program on Arrays and Iterators](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/?Chapter=07). This book is a must-have resource for beginner Ruby programmers. Read the whole thing! Or at least take a look at this chapter on arrays and iterators.

+ [Ruby in 100 Minutes - Arrays](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby_in_100_minutes.html#7.-arrays). This is a quick read on arrays.
